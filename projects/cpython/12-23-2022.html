<p>
	C is annoying. Interfacing with low level compatability issues between windows and unix is annoying. Has to be a better way than conditionally compiling everything everywhere. The guarantee for the PL is that the user doesn't have to worry about all that crap, but ideally the PL itself should be nice to implement it as well... Perhaps that's the tradeoff when writing an interpreted vs compiled language?
</p>

<p>Modularity and having standards is important. Modularity should be on the algorithm (i.e. how python switched between a PEG parser vs an LL(1) parser), but the data structures should be standard between different components. Classic programming principles.</p>

<p>Not dealing with edge cases is good.</p>

<h1> TODO </h1>
<p>
 - Reread entire cpython extensions paper (HPVM, PGUO)
 - Attempt to write some cpython C modules?
