<p> I still don't understand what's going on in 2.1. Moving on to simplex.</p>

<p> I cannot wrap my head around this linear algebra. I looked around
for CF blogs and it sort of made sense - the constraints form a 
convex polygon, and hill climbing always works because of the 
convexity of the function. Moving onto something else though, coming
back to this another day. </p>
