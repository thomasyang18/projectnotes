<p> Gonna work on this over winter break. Math... </p>
<a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~lex/files/dict.pdf">link to bk</a>

<p>
    Chapter 1 I got through since I've been exposed to graph algorithms and DP before. Second chapter I have literally no clue, so I picked up
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G27vjNQUoh4&list=PLXsmhnDvpjORcTRFMVF3aUgyYlHsxfhNL&index=1">this YT series from UT Austin</a>
</p>

<p>
    The goal is to grind through part 2 within the next 2 days. Although today, I can't focus anymore.
