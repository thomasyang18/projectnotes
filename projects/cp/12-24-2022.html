<p>
    First 3 problems were standard, albeit I trolled but whatever. 
</p>

<p>
    I ate dinner with my family midway through the contest so :/. I eventually got problem D towards the end after brute forcing the 
    counterexample to my bitmask solution, then coming up w/ the max solution due to the counterexample. 
    Another case of guessing without proving or trial and error...
</p>

<p>
    Problem E I peeked at the editorial :/. Again, bad assumption that it's always optimal to use nodes s.t. the balance is equal. A terribly easy
    counterexample would have been a tree that looked like [1 (0, 1) -> 2 (0, 0) -> 300 (1, 0) -> 300 (0, 1) -> 300 (1, 0) -> 300 (0, 1) -> 300 (1, 0)].  
</p>

<p>
    If anything, I should get better at making the worst counterexamples to my code, but I'm so motivated to just assume my guesses are right, since 
    less thinking.
</p>

<p>
    For F, I made the observation that the idea was going to be build the string from left to right, inserting a character through rotation, but no idea 
    how to represent that. Will take a look later.
