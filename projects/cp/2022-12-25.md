I did a contest I solved A-D way back, but I decided to VC it again because I wasn't sure I actually understood the solution to D and wanted a hand at E.

I got D, and got the observation for E that only one group of elements grouped by MSB can have >=2 elements. I went down a lot of rabbitholes grouping elements by only their MSB though, I didn't anticipate the stripping bit solution and still don't really understand it. I understand that the 1 + max(F(0, b-1), F(1, b-1)) is saying that one group you keep everything, and the other group you don't remove anything at all, fine. 

My greedy group by bit solution was kind of sus to begin with, since my reasoning was "These have to connect *somehow*". The best "somehow" I came up with was that if you have MSB J, J will always group to a group lower than I. But that ended up with just random guesses. I think this recursive solution is just a classic thing I gotta get more used to
