# Notes
------------------------

This should NOT be a series of notes where I post about a new technique I learned or a video I watched; it was starting to turn into that. Keep that to google keep or something. It's vapid consumption for the sake of feeling productive.

This is a collection of small programs + notes per day on the progress of them (larger programs will obviously be in their own github repos, but smaller programs can rest in here too).

Learning things is a given; applying them in some form is the important thing that I don't do enough of (consuming vs producing).

## Application would be:
- CF rounds (application of skills vs just reading up on them)
- Projects (application of knowledge + research involved)
- PSets (thinking & solving instead of just reading through casually)
- Essays (Writing instead of reading)
- Physical instead of intellectual endeavors are usually application (i.e. touch grass)

## Consumption Counterparts:
- Reading blog or new YT video without applying it OR doing a CF round just cuz and wasting 2 hrs because "I had nothing better to do" (could've played dominion!)
- Excessive research rabbitholes for projects
- Mindlessly consuming textbook/lectures
- Gathering "New Viewpoints" - i.e. scrolling on social media for 5 hours
- Not Touching Grass
