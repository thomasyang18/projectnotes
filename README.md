# Purpose
------------------------
This should NOT be a series of things where I post about a new technique I learned or something; it was starting to turn into that. 

This is a collection of small programs + notes per day on the progress of them (larger programs will obviously be in their own github repos, but smaller programs can rest in here too).

Learning things is a given; applying them in some form is the important thing that I don't do enough of (consuming vs producing).

## Application would be:
- CF rounds (application of skills vs just reading up on them)
- Projects (application of knowledge + research involved)
- PSets (thinking & solving instead of just reading through casually)
- Essays (Producing instead of reading essays)
- Physical instead of intellectual endeavors are usually application (i.e. touch grass)
